# AppiumExploration
Exploratory Project for Appium in C#

This project shows how to set up Appium to test the calculator on any Android device. It requires two things to run locally:

1. Installation of the Android ADB (Android Debug Bridge) tool
2. Setting the PATH in the System-Wide Environment Variables for the ADB location
